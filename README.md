# Doom Fire Algorithm

![Demo](/Demo.gif)

This project attempts to recreate the fire algorithm of **Final Doom** using Swift and SpriteKit. You may use gestures to control the **fire intensity** (swipe up/down) and the **wind direction** (swipe left/right).

## What Iâ€™ve Learned
- Pair programming in practice
- How to handle gestures on SpriteKit
- Further improved my knowledge on GameScenes
- How to use SpriteKit to generate a convincing fire effect

## Requirements
- iOS 11+
- iPhone 6+
